This challenge is about retrieving data from an external api based on user input. 
This repo is far from functioning and is a work in progress. I am still learning how to access the api in a detailed way that fullfils the brief.

I find the bootstrap html hard to decipher and suspect that has a lot to do with my inabililty to put the data on the page. 

Also the code I have is not commented well as I keep re-writing it.
